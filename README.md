# @4lch4/dynatrace-api

This repository is home to an npm library for interacting with the Dynatrace API.

There is an [official library published by Dynatrace][0] but I found it lacking in a few areas:

- The available types are unusual to me.
- Lacks any extra features that would prove extremely useful.
- I just didn't like how it worked/functioned overall üòê
