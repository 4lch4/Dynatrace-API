# @4lch4/dynatrace-api

This repository is home to an npm package for easily interacting with the Dynatrace API for your managed or SaaS instance.

There is an [official library published by Dynatrace][0] but I found it lacking in a few areas:

- The available types are unusual to me.
- Lacks any extra features that would prove extremely useful.
- I just didn't like how it worked/functioned overall üòê

## Dependencies

- [@4lch4/logger][2]
  - A simple library for logging messages to the console.
- [axios][3]
  - A Promise based HTTP client used for interacting with the Dynatrace API.

## devDependencies

- [@types/node][4]
  - Required for using standard Node types.
- [pnpm][5]
  - Added since pnpm is the preferred package manager.
- [prettier][6]
  - Added Prettier as an opinionated code formatter.
- [typescript][7]
  - Added since TypeScript to ensure transpiling with the same version.
